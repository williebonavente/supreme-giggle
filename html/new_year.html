        <h2>Historical Background</h2>
        <p>
          The celebration of New Year's Eve dates back to pre-colonial times,
          where Filipinos would hold festivities to celebrate the start of the
          lunar calendar. Many Filipino people unite on New Year’s Eve, which is
          on December 31, to celebrate a midnight meal known as the Media Noche.
          It is also common to stay awake to greet the coming of the New Year.
          New Year’s Day is also characterized by Filipinos lighting fireworks
          and making a lot of noise to drive away evil spirits. This belief
          originated from the Chinese. The elderly encourage children to jump at
          the stroke of midnight so that they would grow up tall. Many people
          display 12 circular fruits and wear clothing with polka dots to
          symbolize money. It is also popular practice to open all the doors and
          windows at the stroke of midnight to let in the good luck. Many
          Filipino families also read the Christian bible and attend a church
          midnight mass. It is common for many Filipinos to blend religion and
          superstition in celebrating New Year’s Day. The New Year’s Day/New
          Year’s Eve celebrations start on December 31 and continue through to
          January 1. New Year’s Day in the Philippines is short but uniquely
          celebrated throughout the country. This is also the time of the year
          when many Filipino families get together and strengthen their family
          ties. New Year’s Day in the Philippines is a joyful holiday that is
          characterized with the intermarriage of religion and paganism which
          are the attributes of a once Hispanic Philippine Society.
